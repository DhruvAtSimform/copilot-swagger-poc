# Micro-Cosmos: Microservices Architecture with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

## Project Overview

Micro-Cosmos is a microservices-based backend architecture built with NestJS. This project demonstrates the use of GitHub Copilot's Agent Mode to enhance existing microservices with additional capabilities.

## Architecture

The system is composed of several microservices, each handling a specific domain:

1. **Auth Service**: User authentication and authorization
2. **Post Service**: Manage posts, comments, and likes
3. **Cosmo-Chat**: Real-time chat functionality
4. **Mailer**: Email notification service
5. **Logger**: Centralized logging service

## GitHub Copilot Agent Mode POC

We conducted a Proof of Concept (POC) using GitHub Copilot's Agent Mode to add Swagger/OpenAPI documentation to our Post Service microservice. This POC demonstrated the capabilities of Copilot's Agent Mode in understanding and enhancing complex microservice architectures.

### What We Accomplished

- Added complete Swagger documentation to the Post Service microservice
- Created response DTOs for improved API documentation
- Enhanced controllers and DTOs with Swagger decorators
- Fixed ESLint configuration across all microservices
- Documented the process and learnings

### Key Insights

Working with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode provided several key insights:

#### Advantages

1. **Contextual Understanding**: Copilot Agent could understand our complex codebase structure.
2. **Adaptive Problem Solving**: It adapted solutions based on feedback through multiple iterations.
3. **Cross-File Awareness**: Successfully made related changes across multiple files.
4. **Technical Compatibility**: Understood versioning requirements and compatibility issues.
5. **Configuration Fixes**: Identified and resolved complex ESLint configuration issues across services.

#### Challenges

1. **Iteration Requirement**: Multiple iterations were needed to get everything right.
2. **Limited Runtime Testing**: Could suggest changes but couldn't directly test them.
3. **Schema Complexity**: Had some difficulty with complex schema references in OpenAPI.
4. **Decoration Nuances**: Sometimes misunderstood specific decorator requirements.

## Detailed Documentation

For detailed documentation on the specific implementation in the Post Service, please refer to the [Post Service README.md](./postService/README.md).

## Running the Services

Each service can be run individually or together using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up

# Start a specific service
docker-compose up post-service
```

## Swagger Documentation

Once the services are running, you can access the Swagger documentation at:

- Post Service: http://localhost:7003/api

## Conclusion

GitHub Copilot Agent Mode proved to be a valuable tool for enhancing our microservices architecture. While it required oversight and multiple iterations, it significantly accelerated the development process and helped maintain consistency across our codebase.

The ability of the agent to understand complex relationships between files and services made it particularly suited for tasks like API documentation that span multiple components of the system.
